# Aadhaar Enrolment Analysis using Power BI

## Overview
This project presents a data-driven analysis of Aadhaar enrolment data provided by UIDAI. The objective is to identify regional, demographic, and seasonal patterns in enrolment activity and translate them into meaningful insights that can support governance and administrative planning.

## Problem Statement
Aadhaar enrolment data is generated at a massive scale across India. However, extracting actionable insights from this data to understand societal trends, regional disparities, and enrolment behaviour remains a challenge. This project aims to bridge that gap through structured data analysis and visualization.

## Dataset
- Source: UIDAI Aadhaar Enrolment and Update Dataset
- Format: CSV
- Key attributes:
  - State and District
  - Pincode
  - Age Group
  - Enrolment Count
  - Date and Month

Only the UIDAI-provided dataset has been used in this analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- Microsoft Power BI
- CSV data files
- Data transformation using Power Query
- Analytical measures using DAX

## Methodology
1. Merged and cleaned raw enrolment data
2. Standardized age-group and time-based fields
3. Created analytical measures for enrolment aggregation
4. Designed interactive dashboards for visual analysis
5. Interpreted patterns with a governance-focused perspective

### Page 2: Behaviour and Pattern Analysis
- State-wise enrolments by age group
- High-activity districts indicating operational pressure
- Seasonal patterns in enrolment activity
- 

## Key Insights
- Aadhaar enrolment activity varies significantly across states and districts
- Age-group participation differs by region, reflecting demographic structure
- Certain districts act as enrolment hotspots with higher infrastructure demand
- Enrolment trends show clear seasonal patterns

## Impact and Applicability
- Supports identification of high-demand regions
- Enables better allocation of enrolment resources
- Helps plan awareness campaigns for underrepresented demographics
- Demonstrates the value of data analytics in public governance
